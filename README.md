# youtubechannelanalyzer
"A Python Program that analyzes a Youtube Channel and outputs the results." 

This program was created using an HTML page with a form linked to a seperate Python File via Flask. 
The user inputs the "Channel ID" on one page, and once entered it will return all of the stats for that specific channel. 
Channel ID's can be found at the end of a Youtube Channel's link.

What seperates this program from similar websites such as Socialblade is that it shows the average amount of views and Subscribers to Views Ratio of a Youtube Channel.
It can be used for small channels to help understand the activity of their audience, rather than simply praising larger channels with a lot of subscribers!  

This program works well for comparing ratios between channels, and can help people detect channels with very inactive audiences or sub bots.
